Hello World app to see Kannada Unicode support in Pebble.
=========================================================

Two lines, first line using Unicode font Google "Noto Sans Kannada". Second line using "Nudi" font(ASCII font)

Help needed To test this in real Watch. I don't have Pebble Watch, planning to get one during March 2015.
